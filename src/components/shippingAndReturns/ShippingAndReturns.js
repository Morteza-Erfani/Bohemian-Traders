        FAULTY PRODUCTS
        <br />
        Please note that garment and leather colours may look slightly different
        depending on your computer monitor; this is not a manufacturing fault.
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Many of our garments are made by a small community workshops, in
          particular our stunning hand made collection items that are hand block
          printed, vintage kanthas and antique embellished fabrics. They wear a
          story on their skin and visible irregularities are to be considered
          part of their charm, rather than faults (these will not be considered
          faulty if returned).
          <br />
          Every product we send out is quality controlled, however if you have
          received a product with a manufacturing fault (excluding suspected
          shrinkage), please send it back for assessment. Once we have reviewed
          the item we will happily offer a replacement or repair as long as it
          has been returned within 14 days of receiving your purchase. Anything
          outside of this time frame will be assessed at our discretion.
        </p>
        Wear and tear in the course of normal use is not considered a
        manufacturing fault.
      </div>
      <div>
        If you believe your item has shrunk after following the washing
        instructions on the inside of the garment, please take the time to
        review the measurements on the product listing after pressing your item
        in accordance with the instructions. If you send your item back for
        review and we find the measurements to be within tolerance, the item
        will not be replaced and return shipping costs will remain with the
        customer.
